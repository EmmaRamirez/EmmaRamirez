### hi, i'm emma ✨

I'm a frontend technologist, or something like that. Stuff about me:

- 👩🏼‍💻 I mostly work with Typescript & React, but enjoy branching out into other languages and frameworks, like Elixir, Rust, and Wasm
- ⭐️ My far my most popular project is the [nuzlocke-generator](https://github.com/EmmaRamirez/nuzlocke-generator), a very nice tool designed for very nice Pokémon games
- 💃 In my spare time, I enjoy traveling, making new friends, writing, and art
